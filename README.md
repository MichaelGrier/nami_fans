## _Nami_Fans

A fansite I built for my adorable cat Nami. Built using html, css, bootstrap and jquery.

## What I Learned

- using jQuery, waypoints and animate.css to create onScroll animations.
- using onFocus() and onBlur() for dynamic form validation.
- working with the Bootstrap image carousel
